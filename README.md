LKD is a small game engine being developed from scratch for learning and practicing essential game development skills.
Each and every single feature is written from scratch with absolutely no third party code or libraries.

Current features include a fast sprite renderer (no fancy stuff yet), Text rendering, spritesheet support, joystick support, a basic material system, wav audio playback and runtime game reloading. In other words, yes, it is already possible to make small games wit it.
